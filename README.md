Hello, 

I’m @krenren31. I am a medical technologist located on the east coast who is interested in jumping into the data science field.
I am currently learning data analytics and machine learning at Colorado State University with a concentration in machine learning.
I'm hoping to combine my knowledge of the healthcare domain and data analytics to work on some interesting and life-saving projects.

If you would like to collaborate or contact me, just send me an email at renren3126@gmail.com.
